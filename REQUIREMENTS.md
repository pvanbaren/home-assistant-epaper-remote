# Home Assistant ePaper Remote Requirements

## 1. Purpose

This project provides a family-friendly touchscreen ePaper remote for Home Assistant.
It should be fast to navigate, reliable for daily use, and simple to understand.

## 2. Product Goals

- Provide room-based control of house devices without opening a phone app.
- Keep the interface readable and touch-friendly on a 540x960 ePaper display.
- Reflect Home Assistant state changes in near real-time.
- Minimize configuration burden by discovering floors, rooms, and entities from Home Assistant.

## 3. Supported Hardware and Platform

- Lilygo T5 E-Paper S3 Pro
- M5Paper S3
- Firmware built and flashed via PlatformIO environments:
  - `lilygo-t5-s3`
  - `m5-papers3`

## 4. Functional Requirements

### 4.1 Home Assistant Integration

- The device must connect to Home Assistant using the WebSocket API.
- No Home Assistant custom integration/plugin is required.
- The device must authenticate using a long-lived access token.
- The device must discover:
  - Floors
  - Areas/rooms
  - Entities in each room
- Rooms without a floor must be grouped under an "Other Areas" bucket.

### 4.2 UI Modes and Navigation

- The UI must support these states:
  - Boot
  - Wi-Fi disconnected
  - Home Assistant disconnected
  - Invalid Home Assistant token
  - Settings menu
  - Wi-Fi settings
  - Wi-Fi password entry
  - Standby
  - Floor list
  - Room list
  - Room controls
- Navigation flow:
  - Floor list -> Room list -> Room controls
  - Back button from room controls returns to room list
  - Back button from room list returns to floor list
  - Hardware home button returns to floor list (root home) from any UI state

### 4.3 Floor and Room List Screens

- Floor list and room list must render as a grid of tile cards.
- Home (floor list) layout must adapt to the number of floors shown on the current page.
  - When only a few floors are present (for example 3), cards should expand to use the full available space as large, easy-to-tap buttons.
- Grid supports paging by horizontal swipe:
  - Swipe left = next page
  - Swipe right = previous page
- Each tile must show:
  - Name (auto-fit/truncated as needed)
  - Icon (mapped from Home Assistant icon name with fallback)
- Screen must show current list page indicator when page count > 1.

### 4.4 Room Controls Screen

- Room controls must support paging by horizontal swipe:
  - Swipe left = next controls page
  - Swipe right = previous controls page
- The header must show:
  - Back icon button
  - Current room name
  - Page indicator (for multi-page rooms)
- Header styling must prioritize readability:
  - Use the lighter high-contrast style already used on the "Choose a room" page.
  - Avoid dark header backgrounds that reduce room-title legibility.
- Entity ordering on each room page:
  - Climate widgets first
  - Light widgets after climate widgets

### 4.5 Climate Widget Requirements

- Climate widget must be full-width and larger than light widgets.
- Climate widgets must only be shown for cooling-capable climate devices (AC units).
- Thermostat-only climate devices must not be shown.
- AC filtering must be based on Home Assistant `hvac_modes` capabilities:
  - Show only when `hvac_modes` includes `cool` (or equivalent cooling support).
  - Climate entities should remain hidden until `hvac_modes` has been received.
- Climate widget must support:
  - Mode selection with separate buttons
  - Modes: `off`, `heat`, `cool` (only show modes supported by the entity)
  - Target temperature adjustment with `+` / `-` controls
  - Temperature step size: 0.5 degrees
- Active mode must be visually distinct.

### 4.6 Light Widget Requirements

- Light widget must be half-width to allow two per row.
- Light widget must provide on/off control.
- Light widget icon must stay centered with label below.
- Light labels must fit within widget bounds:
  - Font scaling and truncation are required
  - No label text may overlap card borders or adjacent widgets
- Room prefix should be trimmed from light names when duplicated (for readability).

### 4.7 Dynamic Layout and Fitting

- Climate widgets remain fixed at their designed size.
- Light widgets may dynamically shrink to fit page density.
- A minimum light widget height must be enforced to preserve readability and tapability.
- Layout calculations must honor a bottom safe padding so widgets do not overflow the display.
- If a room cannot fit all controls on one page, controls must be split across pages.

### 4.8 Touch Interaction

- Touch targets must include a margin around controls to improve usability.
- Taps activate controls.
- Swipes must not accidentally trigger control toggles.
- Swipe threshold must be high enough to distinguish intentional page navigation from taps.

### 4.9 Text Rendering and Typography

- All UI text must render complete, readable glyphs for the supported character set.
- Lowercase letters must render correctly in all labels and headers (including lowercase `l`).
- Text rendering quality at small sizes must remain legible without dropping or clipping characters.

### 4.10 Hardware Home Button

- Lilygo T5 E-Paper S3 Pro front home button must be supported.
- On Lilygo hardware, home button detection must use the touch controller key channel (GT911/CST226) rather than a dedicated GPIO button input.
- GT911 configuration must be compatible with key event detection (LOW_LEVEL_QUERY mode).
- A home button press must call the same navigation action as `go home` in the store (reset selected floor/room and list pages).
- Hardware without this front button may omit the feature, but must still compile and run without errors.

### 4.11 Cover Widget Requirements

- Cover entities must be supported on room control pages.
- Cover display should prioritize room-level group covers and avoid showing every individual cover device.
- The implementation must support exceptions for important single covers (for example, a projector screen) so they can still be shown even when group-only filtering is enabled.
- Cover widget controls must include at least:
  - `Up/Open`
  - `Down/Close`
- Cover widgets should follow a clean, minimal visual style aligned with other room widgets.

### 4.12 State Synchronization

- Device must subscribe to Home Assistant updates and refresh widget states.
- Commands sent from touch interactions must update Home Assistant entities.
- UI should redraw efficiently:
  - Full refresh on screen transitions
  - Partial refresh where possible for value-only updates

### 4.13 Display Performance Tuning

- Screen transitions (floor list, room list, room controls, and status/error pages) must use a fast clear/update profile.
- FastEPD pass counts must be tuned for responsiveness:
  - Partial update passes reduced from default for faster interactive updates.
  - Full update passes reduced from default for faster screen transitions.
- The room-controls anti-ghosting full-refresh interval must be longer than the default to avoid frequent slow refresh interruptions during active use.
- Climate and cover widgets must support targeted partial redraws:
  - Climate partial redraw should update only mode controls and/or temperature value regions when those values change.
  - Cover partial redraw should update only the up/down control regions when state changes.
- Touch release timeout must be reduced to improve perceived responsiveness for taps and swipe completion.

### 4.14 Settings and Wi-Fi Management

- The floor-list home screen must expose a settings entry point via icon button.
- Settings menu must provide:
  - Wi-Fi settings entry
  - Standby screen debug entry ("open now" behavior)
- Wi-Fi settings view must show:
  - Connection state
  - Active profile (default vs custom)
  - Connected SSID
  - IP address
  - RSSI/signal quality
  - Current error/status line
  - Nearby network list with security state and RSSI
- Wi-Fi settings interactions must support:
  - Trigger scan
  - Select open networks directly
  - Select secure networks and enter password via on-screen keyboard
  - Reset from custom profile back to default configured profile
- Custom Wi-Fi credentials must persist across reboots.
- If startup/default Wi-Fi cannot be connected within a short timeout window, firmware must:
  - Automatically open Wi-Fi settings
  - Trigger a scan so the user can pick an available network
  - Avoid getting stuck on boot screen
- Wi-Fi scanning while disconnected must remain reliable:
  - Scans must return available networks
  - Reconnect logic must not continuously interfere with scan completion

### 4.15 Standby Screen

- Standby mode must auto-activate after 2 minutes without interaction.
- Standby mode must be dismissed by a touch tap and return to home/root view.
- Standby rendering must include:
  - Weather summary card (condition, current temp, hi/low)
  - Multi-day forecast strip
  - Energy summary card using four circular nodes (Solar, Grid, Home, Battery)
  - Energy labels/values rendered below each node for readability
  - Battery node should show current SoC (%) when available
  - Tapping the battery node should request an on-demand SoC refresh without exiting standby
- Standby data refresh behavior must be battery-aware:
  - Active standby UI refresh cadence: hourly
  - Refresh should avoid unnecessary high-frequency updates
- Standby data sources must support:
  - Weather from Home Assistant weather entities/forecast service
  - Energy values sourced from Home Assistant energy preferences (`energy/get_prefs`) with fallback to configured entities

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

### 5.1 Reliability

- Device should recover from Wi-Fi and Home Assistant disconnections.
- If configured Wi-Fi is unavailable at boot, the user must still be able to recover using the on-device Wi-Fi settings flow.
- Discovery and rendering must be robust against large registries and missing icons.
- Memory use must remain stable when opening rooms with many controls.

### 5.2 Performance

- Navigation transitions should feel responsive on ePaper hardware.
- Touch interactions should not block network handling.
- Full screen transitions should prioritize latency over maximum ghost-cleaning quality.
- In-room control changes should prefer partial updates whenever possible.

### 5.3 Readability and Usability

- Typography must remain legible at all supported widget sizes.
- UI should prioritize simple, household-friendly language and visual hierarchy.
- Buttons and controls must be easy to hit for non-technical users.

## 6. Constraints and Assumptions

- Device remains Wi-Fi connected to receive state updates; battery life is limited.
- Display and touch coordinate system is portrait (`540x960` effective UI canvas).
- Maximum sizes in firmware data model currently include:
  - Floors: 16
  - Rooms: 32
  - Entities: 128

## 7. Acceptance Criteria

- User can boot device, connect to Wi-Fi, and authenticate to Home Assistant.
- If default Wi-Fi is unavailable, device automatically opens Wi-Fi settings and allows recovery to another network.
- User can browse floors and rooms via paged tile grids.
- User can open any room without crash or memory panic.
- Dense rooms with many controls are navigable using room control pages.
- Climate controls support mode switching and +/-0.5 degree temperature changes.
- Light controls remain fully visible (no overflow), tappable, and responsive.
- Floor list uses available space effectively (for example, 3 floors shown as 3 large home buttons).
- UI text renders complete lowercase and uppercase glyphs with no missing letters.
- Room page headers remain readable with the same high-contrast style as the room-selection header.
- Cover controls are usable in rooms, showing group covers by default with up/down controls, while allowing configured single-cover exceptions such as a projector screen.
- Back navigation works consistently between all navigation levels.
- Front home button returns to the floor list root from room list or room controls.
- Settings menu is reachable from home and supports both Wi-Fi and standby-debug entries.
- Wi-Fi screen shows live network details and scan results, and supports joining secure/open networks.
- Standby screen appears after idle timeout, can be opened from settings for debug, and exits to home on tap.
- Standby weather and energy data render in readable layout (values below energy nodes).
- UI reflects external Home Assistant state changes after initial load.
- Page transitions feel faster than previous `CLEAR_SLOW` behavior.
- In-room climate and cover control updates visibly redraw only the changed control regions.
